face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000066 size=2>Healthcare is 
          one of the most important aspects of human life. C-DAC's Sushrut, a 
          Hospital Information System (HIS) has been developed with the objective 
          of streamlining the treatment flow of a patient in the hospital, while 
          allowing doctors and other staff to perform to their peak ability, in 
          an optimized and efficient manner. The HIS developed by C-DAC is modular, 
          thus ensuring sustained benefits through changes in technology, protecting 
          and providing optimal returns from the investment. It is modeled on 
          a unique combination of a 'patient centric and medical staff centric' 
          paradigm, beneficial to the recipients and the providers of healthcare. 
          HIS uses a network of computers to gather, process, and retrieve patient 
          care and administrative information for all hospital activities to satisfy 
          the functional requirement of the users. It also helps as a decision 
          support system for the hospital authorities for developing comprehensive 
          health care policies.</FONT> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><BR>
          <FONT 
color=#000066>The HIS incorporates an integrated computerized clinical information 
          system for improved hospital administration and patient health care. 
          It also provides an accurate, electronically stored medical record of 
          the patient. A data warehouse of such records can be utilized for statistical 
          requirements and for research. HIS is based on the exemplar of a centralized 
          information system designed for quick delivery of operational and administrative 
          information. The software is built around a highly optimized core library. 
          Application modules are layered around this core and can be suitably 
          customized for any user specific requirements. Some of the advantages 
          of electronic Patient Medical Records over the conventional paper records 
          are: Prompt and reliable information storage, querying and retrieval. 
          Easy access to query data to generate varied records, including classification 
          based on demographic, gender, age, and so on. Instant information access 
          for research and library information. Efficient and accurate administration 
          of finance, diet, engineering, and distribution of medical aid. Improved 
          monitoring of drug usage, and study of effectiveness. </FONT></font></p>
